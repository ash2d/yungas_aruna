# Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) Implementation for Amphibian Species Dynamics

## Overview

This project implements a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to model the temporal dynamics of two amphibian species: *Oreobates berdemenos* and *Gastrotheca chysosticta* using environmental variables from the `df_helechos_2018_2020` dataset.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Complete Neural ODE Architecture
- **SimpleODEFunc**: Neural network that defines the rate of change `dy/dt = f(t, y, environment)`
- **SimpleNeuralODE**: Complete model with ODE solver integration
- Uses 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for numerical integration
- Incorporates environmental factors (temperature, humidity) as drivers of population dynamics

### 2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Feature engineering with temperature and humidity as primary environmental drivers
- Log transformation for count data to handle zeros and stabilize variance
- Standardization of all features for stable neural network training
- Time series sequence creation for temporal modeling

### 3. Training and Validation
- Implemented robust training loop with error handling
- Model successfully trains on sequence data
- Validation monitoring to prevent overfitting
- Final model achieves convergence with decreasing loss over 50 epochs

### 4. Comprehensive Visualization
- **Training Progress**: Loss curves showing model convergence
- **Species Predictions**: Actual vs predicted trajectories for both species
- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Analysis of how temperature affects species responses

### 5. Biological Interpretation
The Neural ODE provides several key insights:

#### **Continuous-Time Dynamics**
Unlike discrete models, the NODE represents species populations as continuous functions evolving smoothly over time, better reflecting biological processes.

#### **Environmental Coupling**
Temperature and humidity directly influence population dynamics through learned differential equations, capturing how environmental changes drive species responses.

#### **Species-Specific Responses**
Each species shows distinct patterns in their response to environmental factors, reflecting their unique ecological niches and adaptations.

## Technical Advantages of Neural ODEs

1. **Continuous Representation**: Smooth trajectories that better represent biological processes
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Constant memory usage regardless of sequence length
3. **Mechanistic Insights**: Learned dynamics reveal underlying ecological processes
4. **Interpolation Capability**: Can predict at any time point, not just observed times
5. **Environmental Integration**: Naturally incorporates multiple environmental factors

## Future Improvements

1. **Extended Features**: Include additional environmental variables (precipitation, wind, etc.)
2. **Spatial Components**: Extend to spatially-explicit population models
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Implement Bayesian Neural ODEs for confidence intervals
4. **Longer Time Series**: More data would improve model robustness and generalization
5. **Species Interactions**: Explicit modeling of competition and coexistence mechanisms

## Biological Significance

The Neural ODE approach provides a powerful framework for understanding amphibian population dynamics in the context of environmental change. By learning continuous-time dynamics, the model captures the fundamental biological processes that govern species responses to their environment.

The successful implementation demonstrates that Neural ODEs can be effectively applied to ecological data, providing both predictive capability and mechanistic insights into species-environment relationships.
